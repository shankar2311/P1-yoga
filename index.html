            <h2>About Yoga </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Yoga is a fundamental concept in Indian philosophy, psychology and 
                religion and was in older Indian tradition a designation for a number 
                of different physical and contemplative techniques</p>
               Shala is a word in Sanskrit meaning home. 
               A yoga shala, is a home where yoga is shared and experienced. 
               Traditionally yoga is a spiritual practice to attain a higher state of consciousness or liberation.
